# 👋 Hello, World!

## 🎵 Who Am I?
I'm a bel canto vocal teacher by profession and a coding enthusiast by passion. When I'm not teaching singing, I'm developing web applications and exploring new technologies.

## 💻 Tech Stack
```
Frontend: Vue.js (expert) | React.js (intermediate)
Backend: Python 
DevOps: Docker | Web Deployment | Server Maintenance
```

## 🧠 Intellectual Pursuits
- **Large Language Models**: Published research on LLM capabilities and applications
- **Analytical Philosophy**: Interest in language theory and philosophical concepts
- **Full-Stack Development**: Building functional and user-friendly web applications

## 🚀 Current Endeavors
- Learning Rust after building a solid foundation in Python and JavaScript
- Developing educational websites leveraging LLM technology
- Exploring practical applications of large language models in various domains

## 💭 Philosophy
Drawing from Wittgenstein's Language Games theory, I see programming languages as distinct systems with their own rules, meanings, and "forms of life." Just as Wittgenstein argued that meaning emerges through use in specific contexts, I believe code acquires significance through its practical application and the community that engages with it. This philosophical perspective influences my approach to development—understanding that syntax isn't merely formal but connected to practice, that meaning is contextual, and that clarity in expression matters more than abstract correctness.

## 🌐 Independent Projects
As an independent developer, I enjoy working on projects driven by curiosity and practical needs. My focus is primarily on web development and exploring the capabilities of emerging technologies like LLMs. I value clean code, effective solutions, and the learning process that comes with each new challenge.
